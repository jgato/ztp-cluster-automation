# Redeploy  ZTP clusters by name
The script takes only one ar $ARGUMENT with a cluster name. If more than one
ARGUMENT is proved, exit and explayin the command only allows one cluster removal.
But you can call the command several times with different clusters.

Follow these steps:
0. Make a copy of the secrets generated by prepare_clusters command. The secrets to make a copy are named
   'assisted-deployment-pull-secret' and 'clustername-bmc-secret'. Use a temporal directory, local to the project, named
   tmp-clustername.
1. Invoke /remove_clusters with the cluster name
2. Wait the cluster removal. If the cluster has not been removed. Use the skill visualize-cluster-status to show cluster
   removal process. Do not do any other extra checks. Only use the skill visualize-cluster-status to show the cluster
   removal process. Check it every 5 minutes until the cluster is removed.
3. If the Namespace of the cluster was removed, create it again, and restore there the copy of the secrets from step 0.
4. Invoke /deploy_clusters with the cluster name
5. Wait the cluster to be created. Use the skill visualize-cluster-status to show cluster installation process.
   Do not do any other extra checks. Only use the skill visualize-cluster-status to show the cluster installation process. Check it every 5 minutes until the cluster is created.
6. Exit command
